# Plastic Lua Wrap

Plastic Lua Wrap is Lua syntax color theme for VSCode, similar to Plastic Code Wrap, and was created as part of my Gideros VSCode Integration experiment.

Plastic Lua Wrap is a modified version of the [Plastic Code Wrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thunderblaster.theme-plasticcodewrap) color theme by Zack Reithmeyer, which is its self an unofficial port of [Plastic Code Wrap](https://github.com/joedf/PlasticCodeWrap) by Joe DF, which strangely enough is yet another port of the PlasticCodeWrap color theme from textMate, which I am unable to find a link to.

## Preview
This is what your Lua code will look like with the Plastic Lua Wrap color theme enabled...

## Installation

From a terminal window, cd to the folder where the extensions .vsix file is located and execute the following command...

    code --install-extension plasticluawrap-1.0.0.vsix

Optionally you can grab the fantastic [Install .VSIX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-install-vsix) extension by [Fabio Spampinato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/fabiospampinato), then right-click the extension and install directly from the context menu inside VSCode.

## Usage
Once Plastic Lua Wrap is installed, you can activate its color theme by clicking the *"Set Color Theme"* button in the extensions info screen, which can be accessed by selecting *"View > Extensions"* or press *"CTRL + SHIFT + X"*, then locating and clicking on the Plastic Lua Wrap extension in the extension panel.

Optionally you can use the *"File > Preferences > Color Theme"* menu option and select *"PlasticLuaWrap"* from the list of instaled color themes.
