# Plastic Lua Wrap


Plastic Lua Wrap is a Lua syntax color theme for VSCode, similar to Plastic Code Wrap.

Plastic Lua Wrap was created as part of my Gideros VSCode Integration experiment.

Plastic Lua Wrap is a modified version of the [Plastic Code Wrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thunderblaster.theme-plasticcodewrap) color theme by Zack Reithmeyer, which is its self an unofficial port of [Plastic Code Wrap](https://github.com/joedf/PlasticCodeWrap) by Joe DF, which strangely enough is yet another port of the PlasticCodeWrap color theme from textMate, which I am unable to find a link to.
