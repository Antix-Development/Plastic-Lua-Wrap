# Plastic Lua Wrap


## About

Plastic Lua Wrap is Lua syntax color theme for VSCode, similar to Plastic Code Wrap, and was created as part of my Gideros VSCode Integration experiment.

<br>

Plastic Lua Wrap is a modified version of the [Plastic Code Wrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thunderblaster.theme-plasticcodewrap) color theme by Zack Reithmeyer, which is its self an unofficial port of [Plastic Code Wrap](https://github.com/joedf/PlasticCodeWrap) by Joe DF, which strangely enough is yet another port of the PlasticCodeWrap color theme from textMate, which I am unable to find a link to.

## Installation

From a terminal window, cd to the folder where the extensions .vsix file is located and execute the following command...

    code --install-extension plasticluawrap-1.0.0.vsix

Optionally you can grab the fantastic [Install .VSIX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-install-vsix) extension by [Fabio Spampinato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/fabiospampinato), then right-click the extension and install directly from the context menu inside VSCode.
